# TodoApplication
An application to practice Java+Spring in REST API (backend) type of applications.
More features will be added in the future ( propably ;) ).

# How the applicatino works (for now):
- user enters projects with tasks need to be done, with description and deadline (avaiable activity in the browser - localhost://8080/projects with simple frontend)
- tasks can be entered alone with description and deadline (avaiable activity in the browser - localhost://8080/tasks with simple frontend)
- only some of methods are avaiable in frontednd, all methods are in backend.

# Tools used
- Java + Spring (migration to newer version in future)
- H2 + Flyway
- HTML+CSS+Thymeleaf (for simple frontend)
